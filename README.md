## Duolingo's Finnish vocabulary in EDN

This is the Finnish vocabulary from the [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) lessons,
structured into [an EDN file](resource/duolingo-finnish.edn).

The `src/` may later contain some useful functions to process it.

This project can be useful:
- to help the learning process (because the data is now searchable),
- to export this data toward external flash card tools,
- to serve as a sample data for playing with databases or sample apps.
